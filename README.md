# PokeGO-Touch

My personal python script that uses Android Debug Bridge to send inputs to Pokemon GO to automatically open gifts and automatically send gifts.

Designed for screen resolutions of 1080x2400 at 120hz, works on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Assets must be downloaded and native refresh rate must be enabled in Pokemon GO advanced settings.

Requires usb debugging to be enabled in developer options on Android.
