# PokeGO-Touch

My personal Android app that uses an AccessibilityService to send inputs to Pokemon GO to automatically open gifts and automatically send gifts.

Designed for screen resolutions of 1080x2400 at 120hz.

Assets must be downloaded and native refresh rate must be enabled in Pokemon GO advanced settings.
