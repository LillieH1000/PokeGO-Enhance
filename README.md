# PokeGO-Touch

My personal python script that uses Android Debug Bridge to send inputs to Pokemon GO to automatically open gifts for the daily limit of 20 and send total gifts in increments of 4 (will change in the future). Designed for Pixel 8, works on Windows and Linux. Requires usb debugging to enabled in developer options on Android.
